Improved Display of Curved Elements

The first method is to load the surface midpoints by clicking "Read Midpoints" (note: a bug prevents this from working in ParaView 3.8.1-RC1).

The other method is to use averaged surface normal.

    Load internal volume by click "Read Internal Volume" and Apply.
    Hide the "External Surface" by clicking on the eye icon to it's left in the Pipeline Browser.
    Select the "Internal Volume" in the Pipeline Browser.
    Apply "Filter -> Alphabetical -> Extract Surface"
    Then filter the extracted surface "Filter -> Alphabetical -> General Surface Normal"
    Adjust the "Feature Angle" property if sharp creases appear in areas which should be smooth, or vice versa.

A third approach combines the first two. Generating surface normals when midpoints are loaded produces better results than either approach alone.
